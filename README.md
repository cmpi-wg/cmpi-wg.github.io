CMPI pages repository
=====================

This Github project is the place where the CMPI API documentation generated from
the CMPI header files is published.

CMPI stands for "Common Manageability Programming Interface" and is a C-language
API between a Management Broker (aka CIMOM) and Management Instrumentation (aka
Providers). CMPI supports the CIM and WBEM standards defined by
[DMTF](http://www.dmtf.org).

The CMPI Standard (that is, the document) is maintained on the
[CMPI Working Group web space](https://wiki.opengroup.org/councils-wiki/doku.php?id=forums:enterprise_management:cmpi:start).

The CMPI header files are maintained in the [cmpi-headers project on Github](https://github.com/cmpi-wg/cmpi-headers).
The CMPI API documentation is generated and published to this project here
by creating a clone of the cmpi-headers project on your local system
(details TBD).
Requirements for your local system to do that:
- Being on a Linux system
- Doxygen v1.8.6 or higher
